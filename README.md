# Google-Photo-Direct-Link-Generator
Google Photos makes sharing images easy, but it doesn’t provide straightforward direct links that can be used for embedding in websites, blogs, or markdown files. This project solves that problem by generating clean, reliable, and permanent direct links from your Google Photos. With just a few clicks, you can convert any shared photo into a usable link that works across applications, without unnecessary redirects or broken previews. It’s especially useful for developers, content creators, and anyone who wants a simple way to embed Google Photos into documentation, websites, or personal projects.
